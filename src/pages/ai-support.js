      <p>
        With the development of AI and the rise of ChatGPT, this is a relevant
        question to ask. Sure, it can generate new code you have to maintain.
        But can it help you maintain existing code?

        <li>
          <ExtLink href="https://www.codium.ai/">CodiumAI</ExtLink> can help you
          generate tests on existing code. I gave them a hand on the VS Code
          extension in early 2023.

            Rubberduck for VS Code

          . I also contributed to this one. It's an open-source extension that
          can be an helpful assistant.

      <p>
        Here are interesting studies related to the usage of AI to deal with
        existing codebases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <ExtLink href="https://codescene.com/hubfs/whitepapers/Refactoring-vs-Refuctoring-Advancing-the-state-of-AI-automated-code-improvements.pdf">
            Refactoring vs. Refuctoring
          </ExtLink>{" "}
          by CodeScene. They figured that LLMs will generally introduce a
          regression when attempting to refactor complex code. But coupled to a
          fact-checking validation step, tooling could leverage these and only
          suggest the ones that actually work. This is promising because it
          would unlock more powerful automated refactorings.

        <li>
          <ExtLink href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.12450.pdf">
            Can It Edit? Evaluating the Ability of Large Language Models to
            Follow Code Editing Instructions.
          </ExtLink>
          This one concludes that it's a good idea to train models on the
          codebase commits. Also, closed and distilled models seem to be doing a
          better job than open ones. Finally, the more specific the
          instructions, the better.
